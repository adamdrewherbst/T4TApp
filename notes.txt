Initial interview:
	I am making a...
		Vehicle
		Rube Goldberg machine
		Freehand contraption

General procedure:
	Vehicle:
		-place chassis
		-attach wheels
		-optionally add other objects including any desired joints
		-pick course to test on
	Rube Goldberg machine:
		-attach and size simple machines to create framework
		-fill in details using T4T items from catalog
		
-If they abort the standard procedure for making the project,
 they should still be able to add the required components on the fly

Create Screen:
	Buttons on left:
		Choose Object:
			-opens scrollable catalog of object thumbnails
			-types of objects:
				Tubes
				Boxes
				Balls
				Wheels
				Miscellaneous
			-when making a vehicle, the first object you choose must be the vehicle chassis and will be oriented along the z-axis
				later you can add other objects to be included in the chassis, but this allows wheel attachment
		Connect Objects:
			-pick the 2 objects
			-types of constraints:
				Rigid - no relative DOF
					reads "Combine into 1 object"
				Hinge - 1 relative DOF (angle)
					reads "Hinge"
					-must pick edge on each object to serve as hinge axis
					-will connect the midpoints of the 2 edges together,
						rotate & translate object 2 so as to align the edges,
						and place the object centers opposite each other across that edge
				Ball/Socket - 3 relative DOF (angles)
					reads "Ball & Socket"
					brainstorm here - possibilities include:
						-choose from a catalog of ball-and-socket joint styles, then select from a subset of T4T items to
							fill in the ball, the socket, and each rod
						-choose a vertex on each object to connect - the ball and socket will be implicit
			-Wheels:
				-can only be selected once there is a body to attach them to
				-view will temporarily change to side view, letting user pick point in yz-plane, then axle will be placed there parallel to x-axis
				-then switch to front/rear view and allow user to slide wheels in/out along axle if desired

Test:
	Vehicle: choose a testing surface
		-constant ramp
		-loop-the-loop
		-draw your own curve freehand
		-freefall
